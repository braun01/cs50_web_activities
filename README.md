# CS50 Web Week 1 Activities

## Week 2: Django
Example solution will be in the `week2` directory.

### Goal
Make a Django project with one sub app that displays your age on one page, and gets your age on another via a form.

To make a new Django project, run `django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME` in the appropriate directory.

To make a new app, run `python manage.py startapp APP_NAME`.

To start your project, run `python manage.py runserver`.


## Week 1: HTML, CSS + SASS, Python & Git
